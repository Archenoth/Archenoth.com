Who am I? I'm not 100% sure myself.

I like to think that I am a programmer, this much is pretty safe. But
I also want to get good at a lot of things! Art, music, Japanese... My
eventual goal is to make things that can make others happy..!

That sounds super-corny, because it totally is, but it's me in a
nutshell.

I'm the type who gets really inspired seeing the things really skilled
people do--I also really like seeing people come closer to realizing
their goals and ambitions, so I make a pretty good cheerleader if you
need one, hee!

Maybe one day I will put something useful here, but for now, enjoy
links to parts of websites that are not mine.

{% if site.github_username %}
### [The GitHubs](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}})
  {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %} -- Code
  incarnate, and very occasionally reincarnate.
{% endif %}

{% if site.twitter_username %}
### [The Twitters](https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}})
  {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.twitter_username %} -- If
  you ever wondered what goes through my mind on a day-to-day basis,
  you might be somewhere near something that resembles luck.
{% endif %}
