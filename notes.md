I write things on occasion when I am learning about them. Sometimes people find these things helpful.

## [Japanese Pokémon Green](https://github.com/Archenoth/Pokemon-Japanese-School)
> The hardest way to play Pokémon

I am learning Japanese, I like Pokémon, Pokémon was originally in Japanese. See where this is going?

## [Land of Lisp](https://github.com/Archenoth/Land-of-Lisp-notes)
> Lisp is nice and so is Conrad Barski

Awesome book! Not only do you make games to learn Common Lisp, you also end up learning all kinds of neat things about functional programming and a good portion of the book is [made up with comics.](http://landoflisp.com/#guilds)

## [Yodesk Notes](https://github.com/Archenoth/yodesk-notes)
> Where I basically repeat someone else's blog post to you

Notes when following along a [Reverse Engineering tutorial by Zachronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/yoda-stories/) in Lisp!
